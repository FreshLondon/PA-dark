# Ultimate v4.12

Customised dark theme for [Planetarion](https://planetarion.com) created to enhance the 'Round 32' skin. Made with :purple_heart: for my fellow spreadsheet warriors

For anyone wishing to use the styles, please see the raw compiled output found at [/dist/styles.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreshLondon/PA-dark/master/dist/styles.css).

*For any questions / bug reports / assistance, contact @UltimateNewbie on TG. Thanks to Leshy for the original inspiration and CSS grid layout, you rock - forever grateful!*


## Here's some tips:

### INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
* You'll need to enable the 'Round 32' as the base skin in preferences, and a browser extension to add the new CSS to the PA pages.
* [Chrome or other chromium based browsers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) (Brave, Opera, Yandex beta, etc.. pretty much any non-FireFox browser).
* [FireFox stylus extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

* This Dark skin CSS can always be refreshed for new updates etc, it's [found here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreshLondon/PA-dark/master/dist/styles.min.css).
---
###  MOBILE USE:
*  Any chromium based browser (yandex beta, brave, opera, etc) or FireFox (probably use this as that annoying PA calc import bug isn't present) supports addons, use the chrome extension above for any non-Firefox browser.
*  Note: iOS disabled support for firefox extensions, I'd recommend Yandex Beta if on iOS.
---
###  IF IT'S FUCKED:
* Make sure you are not viewing mobile in SIMPLE view or it will look really shit.
* Hit the 'view pages in full version' button (change this at the bottom left of the side menu).

If this skin customisation adds even a tiny bit of enjoyment to your gaming experience it was well worth the countless hours of development.
